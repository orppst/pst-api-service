    \maketitle
    The universe is immense, and it seems to be homogeneous,
    on a large scale, everywhere we look.

    \myfigures{hhg2g_dp}{Dolphins}

    There's a picture of a galaxy above.
    Ha, not really.
    Figure~\ref{fig:hhg2g_dp} shows something to do with the
    meaning of life,the universe, and everything.
    Remember to bring a towel.

    \myfigures{earth_profile}{See, NOT flat}

    Whereas, Figure~\ref{fig:earth_profile} shows a spinning rock of mostly
    molten iron, with some supposedly intelligent creatures living on its
    thin crust.

    Now for some fake citations.
    The Moon is made of cheese~\cite{fakearticle}.
    Female dwarves have beards~\cite{fakebook}.
    I am Ironman~\cite{fakeproceedings}.
