% This is a LaTeX template for the science and technical justifications of an e-MERLIN proposal.
% If you are an observatory administrator of Polaris please modify this template to suit the needs
% of your observatory.
%
% It is the developer's intention that Polaris users simply provide the text for both scientific
% and technical justifications, decorated with minimal LaTex command calls to insert figures and
% citations. We recommend that any tables are included as figures, but we don't impose that as a
% restriction.
%
% To insert figures into their Justifications document users can use the provided, custom
% functions, or could use their own. In either case, the image files that the figures refer to
% must be uploaded by the user.

% Users are expected to provide a bibliography file and use the normal syntax for LaTex citations
% in their text i.e., "~\cite{namedReference}".
